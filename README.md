# leaflet-challenge
imported and visualized data by using Leaflet to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by their color. 

Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Created a legend that provides additional context for map data.
